### **Working with Assets in Nextpy: Creative Examples**

**Understanding Assets in Nextpy**

**What are Assets?**

- Assets are the visual and functional ornaments of your Nextpy project, including images, stylesheets, and icons.
- These treasures are stored in the "assets/" chest within your Nextpy kingdom.

**Referencing Assets in Your App**

- To showcase these assets, simply use their path as a map to their location.

**Example: Showcasing an Image**

- Imagine you've captured a stunning image of a Nextpy dragon, saved as **`nextpy_dragon.svg`** in your assets trove.

```python

xt.image(src="/nextpy_dragon.svg", width="100px")

```

- This spell renders the majestic dragon image in your app.

**Favicon: Your App's Sigil**

- The favicon is like the small, yet mighty sigil of your app kingdom, visible in the browser's realm.

**Downloading Files: Sharing Your Treasures**

- Nextpy empowers your users to download treasures from your server.

**1. Using a Link as a Portal**

- For simple treasures, a portal link suffices.

```python

xt.link("Download Treasure", href="/golden_artifact.png")

```

- Clicking this portal teleports the **`golden_artifact.png`** file to the user.

**2. Mystical Download Button**

- Summon downloads with more sorcery using **`xt.download`**.

```python

xt.button(
    "Summon File",
    on_click=xt.download(url="/mystic_scroll.png"),
)

```

- This magical button, when pressed, conjures the file from the server.

**Customizing File Names: Naming Your Potions**

- **`xt.download`** can cleverly rename the downloaded file, like renaming a potion for its effects.

```python

xt.button(
    "Download and Relabel",
    on_click=xt.download(
        url="/potion_of_wisdom.png",
        filename="elixir_of_insight.png",
    ),
)

```

- The potion file is now known by a new name upon download.

**Uploading Files: Receiving Gifts from Users**

- Nextpy allows your app to receive gifts (files) from users.

**Example: Uploading Portal**

- Create a portal for users to send their files into your app.

```python

def index():
    return xt.fragment(
        xt.upload(xt.text("Send Your Files"), xt.icon(tag="cloud_upload")),
        xt.button(on_submit=State.handle_upload)
    )

```

- This setup invites users to upload files, like sending scrolls via a magical cloud.
