# .agent Folder 

Welcome to the `.agent` folder, our entry point into managing contexts for AI Agents, especially for models like GPT-4. Designed to create efficient and robust AI development pathways in mind, this folder facilitates developers to easily navigate and understand code repositories. It especially takes into account how files are interconnected, giving a complete context about the repository.

This folder is crucial for working with complex codebases, serving as a bridge for both humans and AIs to better understand the large codebases, identify and navigate through the code that need to be altered, and accomplish the correct code modifications. 

It also, especially, aids in enhancing the capabilities of GPT-4 for carrying out wide-scale coding tasks, adjacent to its own potential for making code changes and modifications once guided about the file dependencies and their relations with the rest of the codebase.

## Features
* It assists GPT-4 in comprehending the overall codebase structure and functionality.
* It helps GPT-4 understand the code to be changed that may depend on other parts of the codebase.
* It helps GPT-4 write new code and modify the existing code in a way leveraging and maintaining the existing libraries, modules, and abstractions found elsewhere in the codebase.
* It transfers all of this “code context” to GPT-4 efficiently, fitting within the limited context window.

To optimize the efficiency of GPT-4 in comprehending the larger repos, this folder aids GPT-4 by sending a concise map of the whole git repository that includes the most important classes and functions along with their types and call signatures.

## Code Graph
`.agent` folder houses a Code Graph feature to offer contextual responses based on your codebase. It analyses the structure of the code, examines how different components of the codebase are interconnected and used. This is based on the code's structure and inheritance relationships.

## Installation

To code using the techniques discussed here, all you need to do is install 'codegraph-agent'.

## Contribute

We welcome contributions and your feedback for the `.agent` folder to make it a better tool for developers and AI models to navigate and understand complex codebases.
