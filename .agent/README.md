# .agent Folder 

This is our solution to managing contexts for AI Agents powered by LLMs. Consider it your agent's trusty guide to quickly navigate and understand code repositories while seeing the big picture of how everything is connected.

The `.agent` folder streamlines working with complex codebases by serving as a bridge for understanding and modifying code. It specifically bolsters the capabilities of GPT-4 in larger coding projects, guiding it through dependencies and relations within the codebase.

## Features

- Assists GPT-4 in understanding the codebase structure and functionality.
- Guides GPT-4 in identifying code that needs modifications.
- Helps GPT-4 write and modify code while respecting the existing libraries, modules, and abstractions.
- Efficiently transfers the “code context” to GPT-4 within its context window.

This folder sends a concise map of the whole git repository, including key classes, functions, their types, and signatures.


## Usage

To start coding with enhanced efficiency, simply run 'codegraph.agent'.
