**We have a dream.**

**In the dawn of the Age of AI Agents,** we envision a world where personal digital assistants don't just navigate the vast digital universe but also create and manage it on your behalf. These agents, expressed through code, will generate and orchestrate a library of programs, continuously evolving to meet your needs. However, as the complexity of these programs grows, so does the chasm between human understanding and machine operation. This is where Next.py emerges as a solution, bridging this gap, ensuring that you, the user, maintain visibility and control over the increasingly complex code generated by your AI agents.

But Next.py's vision extends beyond mere technology; it’s about democratizing creativity. Millions of us **have** brilliant ideas for apps and automations, yet these ideas often remain unexplored chasms in the realm of imagination. Next.py changes this narrative. We are democratizing app development, turning your ideas into reality, accessible to anyone with a vision, regardless of their coding expertise. Our mission is to empower you to bring your app ideas to life with simplicity and clarity.

**Do you remember the days when software wasn't just a rental, it was an adventure?** Back then, trading floppy disks felt like sharing buried treasure, each game and app a portal to countless hours of exploration. We owned those pixels, those lines of code, and with them, the freedom to create and share. The current model of software as a service has transformed users into perpetual tenants, constantly paying for what they could once own. Next.py is part of a movement that reverses this trend. By making self-hosting technology simpler and more accessible, we are handing back control to the users. You're not just renting software; you're owning it, controlling it, and ensuring your privacy and security are in your hands.

In this evolving landscape, programming is undergoing a fundamental shift. The emergence of fine-tuned LLMs is leading us into a new era of programming. This era envisions a future where creating and customizing software could be as simple as typing a few lines of English into an AI app. With [Next.py](http://nextpy.org/), get ready for a revolution in citizen programming, similar to how Excel democratized financial programming. Next.py is at the forefront of this paradigm shift. Our framework is not only designed for the current technological landscape, but also for the possibilities of tomorrow. It's a platform where your creativity meets the efficiency of AI, where your visions are not constrained by the complexities of coding, and where the power of technology is once again in your hands.

**This is not just an Manifesto; it's a call to arms.** Join us in shaping a future where technology's power isn't wielded by a chosen few, but by the collective might of dreamers like you. A future where your ideas morph from whispers to vibrant apps, enriching the tapestry of our digital world.

**So, grab your keyboard, fellow revolutionary. Fork our repo, let your code be your battle cry, and add your name to our manifesto.** Every line of code, every shared dream, fuels the engine of this movement. Together, we write the next chapter of software, not just as users, but as creators, owners, and architects of a brighter digital dawn.

The future awaits. Are you ready to code your dreams into reality?
